Okay so, here's the problem,

I need a single source of (reactive) truth for the layout.
There are a couple of sources for the layout, that being:
- A described layout like the one in `test.ts`, that includes the Component that
  needs to be rendered by the Pane/SubPanel
- A serialized layout that is stored like the one stored
  in localStorage, that doesn't include any component

I need to find a way to be able to create a single source of truth (likely in the shape of VizSubPanel[])
that can be used to generate the layout (like it is currently below)

I can maybe use a schema of some sort that describes the layout based on a sort of input structure,
similar to what ProseMirror does, but without all of the complicated shape stuff and regex etc etc.
Just something that sort of describes the shape

Update - 28/06/2025:
I think in V1, if I'm not able to find a decent way to describe a model,
the user will have to create their own tabs/layout on their first launch
and I can give them some pre-configured layouts to choose if they wish.
However, those will have to be custom made and typed out manually :)

We can soooort of generate layouts at the moment (like those stored in localStorage) but those don't contain the
component yet which is a bit of a problem I guess

		{#each internalLayoutState as panel}
			{#if !panel.childs}
				<SubPanel {...panel}></SubPanel>
			{:else}
				{@const subpanel = panel.childs.parentSubPanel}
				{@const id = panel.id + "-" + panel.paneKeyId}
				<SubPanel {...subpanel} header={false}>
					<Panel
						{...panel.childs.parentPanel}
						{id}
						on:resized={(event) => {
							debugEvent(event);
							$layoutState = event.detail;
							saveLayout.set(internalLayoutState);
						}}
					>
						<SubPanel {...panel} />
						{#each panel.childs.subPanel as subPanel}
							<SubPanel {...subPanel} />
						{/each}
					</Panel>
				</SubPanel>
			{/if}
		{/each}
	</Panel>
{/key}
