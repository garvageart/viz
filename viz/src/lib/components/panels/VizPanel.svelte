Okay so, here's the problem,

I need a single source of (reactive) truth for the layout.
There are a couple of sources for the layout, that being:
- A described layout like the one in `test.ts`, that includes the Component that
  needs to be rendered by the Pane/SubPanel
- A serialized layout that is stored like the one stored
  in localStorage, that doesn't include any component

I need to find a way to be able to create a single source of truth (likely in the shape of VizSubPanel[])
that can be used to generate the layout (like it is currently below)

I can maybe use a schema of some sort that describes the layout based on a sort of input structure,
similar to what ProseMirror does, but without all of the complicated shape stuff and regex etc etc.
Just something that sort of describes the shape

Update - 28/06/2025:
I think in V1, if I'm not able to find a decent way to describe a model,
the user will have to create their own tabs/layout on their first launch
and I can give them some pre-configured layouts to choose if they wish.
However, those will have to be custom made and typed out manually :)

We can soooort of generate layouts at the moment (like those stored in localStorage) but those don't contain the
component yet which is a bit of a problem I guess
