# Roadmap to Stable Release
The following items listed in this documenation outline the tasks and features that need to be completed to consider the project stable for release

- [ ] Move all Web UI components to a seperate package
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0
- [ ] Creating a CLI for interacting with the backend
- [ ] Discuss and implement user roles and permissions
- [ ] Make the project setup more modular and customaizable out of the box (e.g. Choosing a photo storage backend like local or Google Cloud Storage)
- [ ] Implementing a gallery display for public collections
- [ ] Implement plugin system for both the user level and the backend level
- [ ] Create native desktop and mobile versions which reduce the need for server size processing as much as possible
- [ ] Support Internationalisation and Localization across the project (front and backend)
- [ ] Enable server-to-server communication and interaction via viz/imagine (URL?) protocol 

N.B Must be EXTREMELY performant (whatever that means depending on the context)
