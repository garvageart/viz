# WAP
WAP (Watch & Put***REMOVED*** is the an ingest program which can take in an image or directory of images and ingest them directly to the `imagine` backend without the use of a GUI.

This is useful for large batch operations that may not require any direct interaction with image files, for example, immediately after a photoshoot where we may offload the JPEGs from the SD card for backup.
